Muti-Processing--and--Multi-threading-Project
=============================================

This is multi threaded and multi processing project (linux programming)in which
the parent file create two process
 1.writer for writing data
 2.reader for reading data

and thease two process than write and read the data by using threads
in each process i create two thread one for printing the data and other 
for writing and reading

In that project i use mutex and flags mehtod for the syncronization
b/w the reading and the writing processes and threads and i use the 
interrupts while one process or thread complete its job.
